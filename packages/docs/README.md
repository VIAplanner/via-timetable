## Vision

When you enter a well-run tech organization like Google, youâ€™re met with a suite of software tools that allow you to do things like :

- Optimize your diet at their cafeterias
- Find interns close to your desk
- Create a roadmap for your growth as a professional

These tools were created by Googlers for Googlers. UofT students could make use of tools made by other UofT students that would allow them to do things like:

- Suggest timetables that optimize for their preferred timings 
- Plan for courses based on course evaluation metrics that they care about
- Write plugins to expand the core functionality with their creative ideas
