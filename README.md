# UofT Course Tools

## Introduction

We're unifying UofT's course data, and using it to build tools such as a course guide and timetable planner.

The fundamental problem we are trying to solve :
1. The current process to choose your courses and manually create a schedule without any conflicts that fit your preferences can take days to perfect.

2. With the help of this tool, we are making this process much faster and easier than before.

3. Furthermore, this will improve UofT's reputation since this tool will modernize a crucial part of a student's life.
